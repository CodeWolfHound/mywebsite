    <h2>My little story</h2>
    <p>I come from a small town called Hidalgo, only a couple blocks away from the Mexican border in South Texas!</p>
    <p>Much of my early career was finding an opportunity to develop my computer skills, but living in a town void of modern technology proved difficult.</p>
    <p>So, I took a career in IT, figuring everyone needs their computers fixed. But then I started to fall in love with programming </p>
    <p>Then I began attending UTRGV (my local university) to pursue my career, but coming from a low income mexican family, it became financially difficult so I had to work full time.</p>
    <p>So on my spare time I began to learn my fundamentals through Python and found it difficult at first, but after building my first 'Hello World,' I felt amazing!</p>
    <p>Now, I currently work as an app developer at a multi-billion dollar global technology company, and I have never been prouder of myself</p>
    <p>If you can take anything away from my story, </p>
